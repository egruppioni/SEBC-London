This was a very nice experience!

I have started with cloudera hadoop six mounth ago and this bootcamp helped me to learn and practice more with the cloudera platform.
 
I will try to deepen the topic of security (specially TLS) that is what slowed me during the course.

This training format helps to deal with what may be the real cases of work, in fact, I really appreciate it

Thanks Rob and Mike
